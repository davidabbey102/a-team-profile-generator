## Description
An HTML page generator populated with employee information generated from a command console set of inputs which loops as long as user has more more employees to add.
I was motivated to create this because with the ever evolving work force, businesses often have fast turnover. This project quickly allows businesses to keep their list updated for internal or external uses.
